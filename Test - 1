Ques 1:
As the question says:  You might have to deal with something related to "a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain".
It's hill Cipher.
Plain text written as matrix * key = cipher text
Plain text = BLUE

Ques 2:
analyse the file using radare2.
pressaa, then V and p.
Head to sys.main().
It takes 3 command line args.
It takes the 3 numbers as co-efficients of a quadratic and gives output accordingly.
Prints "You_have_found__an__answer._Find_the_logic_as_well" if delta==0
Prints roots of the quadratic equation if delta>0.
Prints "Try harder" if delta<0.

Ques 3:
analyse the file using radare2.
press aa then V and p.
Head to sys.main().
main calls sys.func() with 10(mov edi,0xa).
sys.func() is a recursive function to calculate factorial. it calculates factorial of 10 .
The answer is divided by the input we give and if it equals 86400  output is 'Success'.
Therefore,  (10!)/input = 86400. =>input = 42
